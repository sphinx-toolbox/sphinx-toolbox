r"""
Add links to GitHub issues and Pull Requests.

.. extensions:: sphinx_toolbox.issues


Usage
------

.. rst:role:: issue

	Role which shows a link to the given issue on GitHub.

	If the issue exists, the link has a tooltip that shows the title of the issue.

	**Example**

	.. rest-example::

		:issue:`1`

	You can also reference an issue in a different repository by adding the repository name inside ``<>``.

	.. rest-example::

		:issue:`7680 <pytest-dev/pytest>`


.. rst:role:: pull

	Role which shows a link to the given pull request on GitHub.

	If the pull requests exists, the link has a tooltip that shows the title of the pull requests.

	**Example**

	.. rest-example::

		:pull:`2`

	You can also reference a pull request in a different repository by adding the repository name inside ``<>``.

	.. rest-example::

		:pull:`7671 <pytest-dev/pytest>`


.. versionchanged:: 2.4.0

	:rst:role:`issue` and :rst:role:`pull` now show the repository name
	when the name differs from that configured in ``conf.py``.

.. versionchanged:: 2.4.0

	These directives are also available in the :mod:`~.sphinx_toolbox.github` domain.

The only difference between the :rst:role:`issue` and :rst:role:`pull` roles
is in the URL. GitHub uses the same numbering scheme for issues and
pull requests, and automatically redirects to the pull request if
the user tries to navigate to an issue with that same number.


Caching
-----------

HTTP requests to obtain issue/pull request titles are cached for four hours.

To clear the cache manually, run:

.. prompt:: bash

	python3 -m sphinx_toolbox

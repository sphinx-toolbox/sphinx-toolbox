Hack to get the docutils tab size, as there doesn't appear to be any other way.

.. versionadded:: 1.0.0


You probably don't need to use this extension directly, but if you're developing an
extension of your own you can enable it like so:

.. code-block::

	def setup(app: Sphinx) -> Dict[str, Any]:
		app.setup_extension('sphinx_toolbox.github')
		return {}

This will guarantee that the following value will be available via
:attr:`app.config <sphinx.config.Config>`:

* **docutils_tab_width** (:class:`int`\) -- The number of spaces that correspond to a tab when Docutils parses source files.

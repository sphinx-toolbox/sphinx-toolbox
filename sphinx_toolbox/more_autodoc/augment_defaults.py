"""
Sphinx's autodoc module allows for default options to be set,
and allows for those defaults to be disabled for an ``:auto*:`` directive
and different values given instead.

However, it does not appear to be possible to augment the defaults,
such as to globally exclude certain members and then exclude additional members of a single class.
This module monkeypatches in that behaviour.

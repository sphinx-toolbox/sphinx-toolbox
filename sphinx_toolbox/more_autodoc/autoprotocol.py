r"""
A Sphinx directive for documenting :class:`Protocols <typing.Protocol>` in Python.

.. versionadded:: 0.2.0
.. extensions:: sphinx_toolbox.more_autodoc.autoprotocol
.. versionchanged:: 0.6.0  Moved from :mod:`sphinx_toolbox.autoprotocol`.
.. versionchanged:: 2.13.0  Added support for generic bases, such as ``class SupportsAbs(Protocol[T_co]): ...``.


Usage
-------

.. rst:directive:: autoprotocol

	Directive to automatically document a :class:`typing.Protocol`.

	The output is based on the :rst:dir:`autoclass` directive, but with a few differences:

	* Private members are always excluded.
	* Special members (dunder methods) are always included.
	* Undocumented members are always included.

	The following options from :rst:dir:`autoclass` are available:

	.. rst:directive:option:: noindex
		:type: flag

		Do not generate index entries for the documented object (and all autodocumented members).

	.. rst:directive:option:: member-order
		:type: string

		Override the global value of :any:`sphinx:autodoc_member_order` for one directive.

	.. rst:directive:option:: show-inheritance
		:type: flag

		Inserts a list of base classes just below the protocol's signature.

	See https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html
	for further information.


.. rst:role:: protocol

	Role which provides a cross-reference to the documentation generated by :rst:dir:`autoprotocol`.


.. latex:vspace:: 5px
.. seealso:: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html
.. clearpage::


**Examples:**

.. literalinclude:: ../../../autoprotocol_demo.py
	:language: python
	:tab-width: 4
	:lines: 1-31
	:linenos:

.. rest-example::

	.. automodule:: autoprotocol_demo
		:members:
		:no-autosummary:
		:exclude-members: HasGreaterThan

	.. autoprotocol:: autoprotocol_demo.HasGreaterThan

	The objects being sorted must implement the :protocol:`~.HasGreaterThan` protocol.
